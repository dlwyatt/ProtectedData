function Get-KeyEncryptionCertificate
{

    .Synopsis
       Finds certificates which can be used by Protect-Data and related commands.
    .DESCRIPTION
       Searches the given path, and all child paths, for certificates which can be used by Protect-Data. Such certificates must support Key Encipherment (for RSA) or Key Agreement (for ECDH) usage, and by default, must not be expired and must be issued by a trusted authority.
    .PARAMETER Path
       Path which should be searched for the certifictes. Defaults to the entire Cert: drive.
    .PARAMETER CertificateThumbprint
       Thumbprints which should be included in the search. Wildcards are allowed. Defaults to '*'.
    .PARAMETER SkipCertificateVerification
       Deprecated parameter, which will be removed in a future release.  Specifying this switch will generate a warning.
    .PARAMETER RequirePrivateKey
       If this switch is used, the command will only output certificates which have a usable private key on this computer.
    .EXAMPLE
       Get-KeyEncryptionCertificate -Path Cert:\CurrentUser -RequirePrivateKey

       Searches for certificates which support key encipherment (RSA) or key agreement (ECDH) and have a private key installed. All matching certificates are returned.
    .EXAMPLE
       Get-KeyEncryptionCertificate -Path Cert:\CurrentUser\TrustedPeople

       Searches the current user's Trusted People store for certificates that can be used with Protect-Data. Certificates do not need to have a private key available to the current user.
    .INPUTS
       None.

   # it was only used to search for a single thumbprint, and threw errors back to the caller if no suitable cert could
   # be found. Now I want it to also be used as a search tool for users to identify suitable certificates. Maybe just
   # needs to be two separate functions, one internal and one public.
